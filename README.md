This is a little bit of analysis code written to generate some statistics about the Plans of Study for PhD students in Purdue's Engineering Education (ENE) department. It's a one-off, hastily written to grab answers to a few specific questions we wanted to know at the time. It's not very well defined, because the queries weren't very well-defined -- we don't yet know what questions we want to ask long-term.

However, I'm not discounting the possibility that someone may want or need to pick this up again at some point in the future when those questions do become more well-defined. So I have written simple code, heavily commented, and tried to mark (inline, in the code comments themselves) some easy places to improve it for future people who may be interested in reusability someday.
